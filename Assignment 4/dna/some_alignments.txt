Significance: H3N2 is a strain of influenza that primarily infects pigs; only ~300 cases of human infection were recorded.
On the other hand, H1N1 is a very common strain that is known to easily infect humans. Despite the host preferences, this
gene is very highly conserved, suggesting it is required more for function rather than selectivity.

Significance: 18S and 16S are subunits of the ribosomal complex; in other words, these genes are responsible for coding for the machinery that
transcribes DNA into RNA (and ultimately into protein). At first glance, we see many differences; however, towards the end we see an extremely
large number of matches. This is no coincidence; despite how genetically different we are from bacteria, these highly conserved sequences at
the end are crucial for protein function.
