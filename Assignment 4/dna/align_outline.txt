Base cases: When comparing anything (including empty string) to empty string
Starting with two strings, we make recursive calls to compare shorter versions of these two strings:
	ver. 1) introduce a gap in string 1, remove a character in string 2
	ver. 2) remove a character in both strings
	ver. 3) introduce a gap in string 2, remove a character in string 1
When a base case is reached, whichever has the highest score is the best alignment

As it is now, this outline is strictly recursive.

Perform dynamic programming by memoizing.
We memoize specifically the comparison of two strings, their score, and their alignment instruction.
