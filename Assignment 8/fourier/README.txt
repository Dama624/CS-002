The Fourier transformation of a sine wave should look like two Dirac delta
functions, both facing opposite directions, with imaginary amplitudes (
assuming that the sine wave is a pure sine wave, with no cosines).
The DFT of the same signal should be the same, but the spikes have
non-infinite length dependent on the amplitude of the sine wave.
With more complicated signals, more and more spikes of various heights will
emerge along the frequency axis.
